# GCD
Given an integer array nums, return the greatest common divisor of the smallest number and largest number in nums. <br>

The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers. <br>

 

**Example 1:** <br>

Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10] <br>
Output: 2 <br>
Explanation: <br>
The smallest number in nums is 2. <br>
The largest number in nums is 10. <br>
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2. <br>

**Example 2:** <br>

Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3] <br>
Output: 1 <br>
Explanation: <br>
The smallest number in nums is 3. <br>
The largest number in nums is 8. <br>
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1. <br>

**Example 3:** <br>

Input: nums = [3,3] <br>
Output: 3 <br>
Explanation: <br>
The smallest number in nums is 3. <br>
The largest number in nums is 3. <br>
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3. <br>
 

**Constraints:** <br>

2 <= nums.length <= 1000 <br>
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000 <br>
