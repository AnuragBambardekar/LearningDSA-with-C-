# Needle In a Haystack
## Problem Description
Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

**Clarification:** <br>
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
 
**Example 1:** <br>
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll" <br>
Output: 2 <br>

**Example 2:** <br>
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba" <br>
Output: -1 <br>

**Example 3:** <br>
Input: haystack = "", needle = "" <br>
Output: 0 <br>

 
**Constraints:** <br>
●	0 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 5 * 104 <br>
●	haystack and needle consist of only lower-case English characters. <br>
