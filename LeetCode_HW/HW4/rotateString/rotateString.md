# Rotate String
## Problem Description
Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position. <br>
●	For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 
**Example 1:** <br>
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab" <br>
Output: true <br>

**Example 2:** <br>
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced" <br>
Output: false <br>

 
**Constraints:** <br>
●	1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100 <br>
●	s and goal consist of lowercase English letters. <br>

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool rotateString(string s, string goal) {
        
    }
};
